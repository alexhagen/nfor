``nfor`` - Nested for loops
===========================

Python is great, and easy to write, but some design choices donâ€™t work out for specific edge cases.  In some of my research, I found myself performing grid searches over many variables. To do this, you have to have many indented ``for`` loops, and the actual programming lines end up way to short to write anything useful.  Enter ``nfor``, where you can do that in one indentation.
